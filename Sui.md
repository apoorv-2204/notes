- Published modules are immutable objects in Sui; an immutable object is an object that can never be mutated, transferred, or deleted. Because of this immutability, the object is not owned by anyone, and hence it can be used by anyone
- - A Move package is just a collection of modules with a manifest file called Move.toml
